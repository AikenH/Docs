# Debugs in Torch
@Aiken Hong 2021 

Record Bugs Appear in my work, which is hard or Annoying somehow.
But Solve bugs are not what we want, we should learn to avoid writting bugs.

==Write Better Code, Write Beautiful Code==

## Principles we learned

In this part we summarized those bugs we have meet, and  then determine some **principles** in the future coding.

## Specific Bugs

Classify the bug we meet accroding to its' TYPE
⬇️ Specifically, it can be divided into the following categories: 

Data, Strucuture, Dismatch, Garmmar

---
Then Start Here🚯 :

### Data

==All the operations are composed by data, data is foundation of each line of code==

数据是最我们编码中重要的一部分, 也是特别容易出错的一部分, 在这一部分可以详细的划分成很多子课题进行汇总.
